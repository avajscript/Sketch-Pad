### This took me a good day of work to make. Some of the features include...
* Selecting colors
* Click to draw + mouse button down
* Clear screen
* Eraser
* Changing grid size
### The main struggles were...
I was unsure how to create a rbg color palate with all colors, so I decided to create a color palate with only select few colors.
Changing the grid to resizable was annoying because I had to rewrite my solution. Originally using **16x16 grid**, I switched to creating lines of **divs** in my javascript file.
